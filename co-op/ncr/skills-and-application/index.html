<p>This position at NCR required a diverse skill set; strong written and oral communication, an analytical mind, and initiative. I had developed these skills through school, but working in a professional team-based setting helped to add to these areas in ways not otherwise possible. In particular, the skills that proved most important during the work term were communication and initiative. By working in a fast-paced Agile development team, I learned how to coordinate requirements and activities with team members and do what it takes to meet deadlines.</p>
<p>This was my second work term and my first time working in a professional team environment. Though I worked with peers in my first work term, it does not compare to a dedicated scrum team. There is an aspect of independence when you work on your own stories, but the underlying responsibility of each team member is contributing to the team. As my supervisor told me during a meeting, “Your progress is our progress”. It was reassuring to know that everyone on the team trusted one another to do their part. New problems would come up every day, but there were always multiple avenues of solving problems; explaining the issue to team members, opening discussion in stand-up meetings, drawing diagrams to fuel discussion. I never felt limited to tackling a problem on my own. With the experience gained, I am much more confident in working with others on diverse problems. This will no doubt aid me in my school career, especially in group project courses.</p>
<p>The team aspect of the role also allowed me to improve my communication skills. When I asked one of my team members for help, I would articulate the problem by replicating it and providing context. I would talk to different members on the team depending on my query as each person had their own unique skill set. I would contribute to discussion during team meetings and participate in demos at the end of every sprint.</p>
<p>My time at NCR has enhanced my academic experience, as I was worked in an agile development environment once again. When I was first taught about agile methodologies through lectures, the entire concept of it eluded me. By experiencing it first-hand through my work terms though, I’ve become intimately familiar with how agile development works. The opportunity to immerse myself in this environment helped me to solidify the knowledge I have gained from University.</p>
