  <h1 class="u-lead center">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>I would like to recognize those who helped me during my work term by making a few acknowledgments.</p>
<h2 class="u-sublead">Auvik</h2>

<p>Firstly my manager at Auvik, James Cherry. James is a fantastic manager all around. He was open to ideas, very thorough in his explanations, and put a strong focus on autonomy. James was aware of my passion for problem-solving. He helped to involve me in tasks that challenged me despite the fact that he could solve them easily. He always took the time to ensure I was content with my work despite having his own agenda of tasks to finish, and I am so grateful for that. I also appreciate the fact that James was open to talking about himself and getting to know me as a person rather than an ordinary co-op student. I sincerely hope to remain in contact with him beyond my work term.</p>
<p>Another thank you is to three full-time co-workers on my engineering team: Ken De Souza, Micheal Brown, and Bhee Persaud. Ken helped to train me upon arrival and show me all the ropes. Micheal was my "manager" during the weeks that James was away; though he was very busy with his duties as director, he always made time to discuss any concerns I had. Bhee was incredibly friendly and helped me to warm up to my other co-workers. I am very grateful to them as they helped me to settle in as fast as I could.</p>
<h2 class="u-sublead">University of Guelph</h2>

<p>From the school side of my co-op experience, I would like to give special thanks to Laura Gatto for being so understanding and supportive during such a delicate transitional time. Without her help, I would not have the opportunity to work for Auvik this term. I know she has many important duties to attend to, and I appreciate the hard work and time she dedicated to my success in my co-op semester.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Greg Klotz as well for always being willing to help and taking the time to read my work report. I know he is incredibly busy and has many work reports like this to read, and I appreciate the consideration and care he puts towards each one.</p>
<p>Thank you, everyone ðŸ™‚</p>
