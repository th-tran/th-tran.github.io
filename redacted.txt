<h2 class="u-sublead">Interests</h2>

My interests include gaming, programming, piano, and puzzles. In my downtime,
you'll likely find me coding, developing applications, pretty much anything where I can stay to myself and learn.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Endgame Goals</h2>

<h3>Personal</h3>
As with many others, there's a single question I've yet to answer:

<br>
>> <em>What makes me important?</em>

<br>
My personal goals attempt to answer this. I want to <strong>pay off my student debt</strong> as soon as possible and <strong>find fulfillment</strong> in life through invaluable relationships and rewarding work. I hope to <strong>travel the world</strong>; discover different cultures; seize all the opportunities I've never known growing up. Lastly, I want to <strong>master my interests</strong> and become pro at whatever I love, even if it's just for myself (for instance, getting a sub 30 average solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube).

<h3>Professional</h3>
Prior to university, my mind was set to become a video game developer. However,
I have learned so much more about this field than I expected through emerging technologies and my co-op experience. For better or worse, my career goal have since become blurred. I've now considered all the following as my future career:

  * <strong>video game developer.</strong>
  * <strong>web developer.</strong>
  * <strong>mobile developer.</strong>
  * <strong>software tester.</strong>

The paths are endless when it comes to Computer Science - I've definitely learned that during my time at university. I'm sure that wherever my path may lead though, I'll find happiness in it.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Courses Taken</h2>
The following are all the courses in which I've been enrolled in during my time at the University of Guelph, along with the grade I achieved.
