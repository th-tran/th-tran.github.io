<h1 class="u-lead center">Introduction</h1>

My name is Thomas Tran. I am currently enrolled at the University of Guelph and am preparing to embark on my third year of school
in a Bachelor of Computing degree, specializing in Computer Science. I have also just completed my first work term (4 months) at Auvik.
Through working with the Co-op program at my university, I've been given the amazing opportunity to grow professionally and apply my knowledge from the classroom in the industry.
I plan to explore many areas of my major, but right now I have an interest in expanding my knowledge in web development, task automation,
game development, databases, algorithms, and programming in general.

I am also pursuing a minor in Statistics; I have a keen interest in probability and statistical applications in computing as well.

If there's one thing I hope you get from your visit, it's a glimpse of what it's like to have the opportunity to study at this university and work in a computing-based position at these companies. I hope this site will inspire you to explore a similar path in your own life.
