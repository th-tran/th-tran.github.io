<h1 class="u-lead">Nice to meet you.</h1>

My name is Thomas Tran. I am currently enrolled at the University of Guelph, ready to enter my second work term at NCR and embark on my 3rd year of school
studying Computer Science. Through working with the Co-op program
at my university, I've been given the amazing opportunity to grow professionally and apply my knowledge from the classroom in the industry.

I am also pursuing a minor in Statistics; I have a keen interest in probability and statistical applications in computing as well.

If there's one thing I hope you get from your visit, it's a glimpse of what it's like to have the opportunity to study at this university and work in a computing-based position at these companies. I hope this site will inspire you to explore a similar path in your own life.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Interests</h2>

My interests include gaming, programming, piano, and puzzles. In my downtime,
you'll likely find me coding, developing applications, pretty much anything where I can stay to myself and learn.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Endgame Goals</h2>

<h3>Personal</h3>
As with many others, there's a single question I've yet to answer:

<br>
>> <em>What makes me important?</em>

<br>
My personal goals attempt to answer this. I want to <strong>pay off my student debt</strong> as soon as possible and <strong>find fulfillment</strong> in life through invaluable relationships and rewarding work. I hope to <strong>travel the world</strong>; discover different cultures; seize all the opportunities I've never known growing up. Lastly, I want to <strong>master my interests</strong> and become pro at whatever I love, even if it's just for myself (for instance, getting a sub 30 average solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube).

<h3>Professional</h3>
Prior to university, my mind was set to become a video game developer. However,
I have learned so much more about this field than I expected through emerging technologies and my co-op experience. For better or worse, my career goal have since become blurred. I've now considered all the following as my future career:

  * <strong>video game developer.</strong>
  * <strong>web developer.</strong>
  * <strong>mobile developer.</strong>
  * <strong>software tester.</strong>

The paths are endless when it comes to Computer Science - I've definitely learned that during my time at university. I'm sure that wherever my path may lead though, I'll find happiness in it.
