During my 4-month work term, my role at IBM was a Web developer. My normal duties included server-side scripting and maintaining databases - the skills I needed most for the job were experience in JavaScript and related frameworks such as React and Express. Good communication with team members was an important factor of success in this role. This is because of the highlight of the term; I wrote the back-end to a new Node microservice that is being integrated across the entire cloud platform.  By collaborating with direct teammates (both front-end and back-end developers) and related teams (design, content, analytics), we combined our efforts to build a complex system that would personalize the experience of our cloud users. To see a new project through from start to finish in only four months was truly the most unique aspect of my job. I worked closely with my supervisor, Nancy Ching, to define and achieve various milestones along the way. The most rewarding part of my job was the responsibility given to me as a co-op student. Between my co-workers, my supervisor and my manager, I wasnâ€™t treated any differently. I worked on challenging tasks and contributed over 2000 lines of code to our personalization project. Because of this trust, I gained exposure to professional code and obtained a deep understanding of asynchronous programming through server-side code.
