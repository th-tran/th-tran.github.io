<h1 class="u-lead center">Acknowledgements</h1>

I would like to recognize those who helped me during my work term by making a few acknowledgments.

<h2 class="u-sublead">IBM</h2>

Firstly my supervisor, Nancy Ching. Nancy is a fantastic supervisor all around. She was open to ideas, very thorough in her explanations, and never failed to spark enthusiasm. Nancy knew exactly how to bring up others to do their best work. She never failed to give kinds words when I performed above expectations and give constructive, precise feedback so I could continually improve. She always took the time to ensure I was content with my work despite having her own agenda as the team lead, and I am so grateful for that. I also appreciate that Nancy encouraged me to broaden my social network at work and share what Iâ€™ve learned with others. If it werenâ€™t for Nancy, I would not have reached the same level of potential that I did. I hope to remain in contact with her beyond my work term.

Another thank you is to my manager and two full-time co-workers: Chris Lynk, Yacine Brahimi, and Sai Mohan respectively. Chris was someone who genuinely cared about all employees on a personal level, and a co-op student was no exception. He would always free up time in his busy schedule to talk with me, make sure I was content, and provide any assistance I needed. Yacine was always approachable and helped to train me throughout the term. Sai was incredibly friendly and helped me to warm up to my other co-workers. I am very grateful to them as they helped me to settle in and do my best work.

<h2 class="u-sublead">University of Guelph</h2>

From the school side of my co-op experience, I would like to give special thanks to Laura Gatto for being so understanding and supportive during such a delicate transitional time. It was my first time in Ottawa, but when she came to Ottawa personally for the co-op visit it felt like I never left Guelph. I know she has many important duties to attend to, and I appreciate the hard work and time she dedicated to my success in my co-op semester.

I would like to thank Greg Klotz as well for always being willing to help and taking the time to read my work report. I know he is incredibly busy and has many work reports like this to read, and I appreciate the consideration and care he puts toward each one.


Thank you, everyone ðŸ™‚
