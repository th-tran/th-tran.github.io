Auvik is a private company that focuses on simplifying Information Technology (IT) network management for businesses. Founded in 2011, Auvik is rapidly building up a notable presence. The company has grown from 6 employees to over 80 employees, and their latest funding round was a Series C for $15.6M on May 2018. Network management has always been a long-standing issue (think “from the ‘70s” long), yet few have attempted to solve it due to its sheer complexity. Auvik aims to use cloud-based software to reduce this complexity to simple, automated steps.
