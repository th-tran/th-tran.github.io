<h1 class="u-lead center">Acknowledgements</h1>

I would like to recognize those who helped me during my work term by making a few acknowledgments.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Auvik</h2>

Firstly my supervisor, Jeewhoon Park. It was clear that Jeewhoon wanted co-ops to succeed. He was open to discussion, very thorough in his explanations, and put a strong focus on teamwork. He helped me integrate with the team. Despite his busy agenda, he always took time to follow up on me through casual discussion and one-on-one meetings to check up and hear my thoughts. I appreciate the fact that Jeewhoon was completely honest when giving feedback throughout the term. It was blunt at times, but necessary â€“ I knew he wanted me to succeed. I was able to work on my weaknesses during this work term and get a better idea of important goals for my next work term. I truly hope to remain in contact with him beyond my work term.

I would also like to thank everyone on my scrum team. I appreciate how I was treated just like any full-time team member. Each person on the team was more than willing to help me whenever I had any concerns, yet I never lost that sense of independence within the team. There must have been times when I had extended debugging sessions with each individual person on the team, but I would not uncover anything without the patience and insight of each member. And at the end of the day, these small successes were celebrated with treats for everyone! I am very grateful to work with you all â€“ you made my experience at NCR better than I ever hoped for.

From the school side of my co-op experience, I would like to give special thanks to Kate McRoberts. I met with her the first time during my work term, but with the amount of understanding and encouragement she offered I could easily forget that. She followed up with me over the term, and I never felt alone. I know she has many important duties to attend to, and I appreciate the hard work and time she dedicates to help students succeed during co-op semesters.

I would like to thank Greg Klotz as well for always being willing to help and taking the time to read my work report. I know he is incredibly busy and has many work reports like this to read, and I appreciate the consideration and care he puts towards each one.

Thank you, everyone ðŸ™‚
