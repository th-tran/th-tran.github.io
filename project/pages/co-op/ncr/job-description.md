During my 4-month work term, my role at NCR was a Software Development Intern. My experience at NCR was very different compared to my past work term. Barring the final month, my duties matched those of the full-time members on my scrum team. Ultimately, this meant that I worked on the very same product that was delivered to the bank via refactoring code, removing obsolete components and implementing new features into it. Though my team members were all busy full-times, they were never dismissive and always provided support when needed. By providing a nurturing environment, I was able to ramp up more easily. I started with simple tasks like modifying configuration files, moved on to implement new APIs and ended with integrating these APIs into a sample teller app. I enjoyed this aspect of the role – being exposed to all parts of the application – as it taught me the high-level structure of the product and helped me become a better programmer.
