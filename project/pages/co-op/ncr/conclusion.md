<h1 class="u-lead center">Conclusion</h1>

One of the key things I hoped to get out of this co-op placement was the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment that not only challenges me, but also fosters professional and personal growth. I was not disappointed. NCR was the placement I was hoping for in regards to soft skills and technical knowledge. They offered me a wide variety of opportunities, and Iâ€™ve become a better team member and a better coder as a result. I am highly familiar now with software development practices, collaborative software development, and version control software in the context of a team. The different challenges presented during my work term allowed me to make meaningful progress towards many of the goals set for myself at the beginning of the semester, as well as set standards for goals I will carry into my next work term. I am very thankful for the opportunity to work for NCR.
