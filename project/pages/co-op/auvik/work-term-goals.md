<h1 class="u-lead center">Work Term Goals</h1>

I had many goals for this work term, but the goals listed below were the most important to me.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Goals targeted at skills</h2>

A goal I held at high priority for this work term was developing upon my programming skills. In particular, my focus was to improve upon my debugging skills and ability to make informed design decisions. My role was very independent by nature; though my manager was always available to talk through problems, he would always allow me to approach problems at my own angle. As the term progressed I became more aware of how I tackled problems. I would discuss issues with others and gather their insight before settling on a solution. I would draw out diagrams as projects grew larger in scale, making sure to understand the entire scope of the program before attempting to debug it. Both my manager and I noticed how my coding improved over the course of working at Auvik. Though I cannot say that I achieved this goal, I certainly made considerable progress.

Another skill that I aimed to improve during this work term was my communication. I was able to work on this goal as our team participated in daily stand up meetings that required updates from each team member, as well as weekly sprint meetings that required team members to prepare in advance, articulate their current status, and discuss plans for the next sprint.

My last goal was to work on my personal organization skills and learn to effectively manage my time. Due to the nature of my role, this goal was surely achieved. Unlike school assignments with set rubrics and deadlines, much of my work involved open tasks with flexible deadlines. I was put into a position where I had to _judge myself_ on my work performance. With each sprint, I learned more about the extent of my capabilities â€“ it became easier to set out a plan, chunk tasks and allocate my time in a more effective manner. Upon completion of my time at Auvik, I  feel very confident in my ability to organize myself and feel that, as a professional, I understand myself better now.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Goals targeted at technology</h2>

My first goal targeted at technology was to learn and become proficient in Python. My manager assisted me in reaching this goal, as he gave me in depth code reviews, his own code to review, and the opportunity to take charge of a web application to develop alone. This motivated me to write properly architected code that could be built upon and maintained with minimal effort.

My second goal targeted at technology was to feel comfortable with using REST APIs to interact with web services and modify data, and helping to complete the integration of automated tasks with Kubernetes. I spent a significant amount of time researching how REST works and modifying test data in a sandbox environment. This effort ensured I was comfortable using these APIs on production where they would modify real customer data. I was also a key player in the process of integrating the automated report generation with Kubernetes, a container-orchestration system. This was a great learning experience, as I had no prior experience with Kubernetes. Not many people were familiar with it either as it was a relatively new system, so being heavily involved with this setup was very challenging and exciting.
