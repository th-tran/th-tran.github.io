<h1 class="u-lead center">Acknowledgements</h1>

I would like to make a few acknowledgements to recognize those who helped me during my work term.

<h2 class="u-sublead">Auvik</h2>

Firstly my manager at Auvik, James Cherry. James is a great manager all around. He was open to ideas, very thorough in his explanations, and put a strong focus on autonomy. James was aware of my passion for problem solving and really helped to involve me in tasks that challenged me despite the fact that he could solve them very easily. Though he had his own agenda of tasks to complete, he always took his time to make sure I was happy with my own tasks and I am so grateful for that. I also appreciate the fact that James was open to talk about himself and getting to know me as a person rather than just a co-op student. I definitely hope to remain in contact with him beyond my work term.

Another thank you is to two full-time co-workers on my engineering team, Ken De Souza and Bhee Persaud. Ken helped to train me upon arrival and show me all the ropes. Bhee was incredibly friendly and helped me to warm up to my other co-workers. I am very grateful to both of them as they helped me to settle in as fast as I could.

From the school side of my co-op experience, I would like to give special thanks to Laura Gatto for being so understanding and supportive during such an important transitional time. Without her help, I would not have the opportunity to work for Auvik this term. I know she has many important duties to attend to, and I appreciate the hard work and time she dedicated to my success in my co-op semester.

I would like to thank Greg Klotz as well for always being willing to help and taking the time to read my work report. I know he is very busy and has many work reports like this to read, and I appreciate the consideration and care he puts towards each and every one.

Thank you everyone ðŸ™‚
