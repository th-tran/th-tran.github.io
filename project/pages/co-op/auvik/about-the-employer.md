Auvik is a private company that focuses on simplifying Information Technology (IT)
network management for businesses. Founded in 2011, Auvik is rapidly building up a
notable presence. The company has grown from 6 employees to over 80 employees,
and their latest funding round was a Series C for $15.6M on May 2018. Network management
has always been a long-standing issue (think “from the ‘70s” long), yet few have
attempted to solve it due to its sheer complexity. Auvik aims to use cloud-based
software to reduce this complexity to simple, automated steps.
