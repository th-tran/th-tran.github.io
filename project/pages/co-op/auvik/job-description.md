During my 3-month work term, my role at Auvik was a Software Development Intern. Using primarily Python, my purpose was to collect and process financial data from a variety of sources, write programs to generate custom reports for customers, and automate these tasks in a cloud-based cluster of machines. As this was my first work term, I needed to demonstrate fast learning and acquire these skills on the job.  Due to Auvik's infrequent hiring of co-op students, I was placed on the team of full-time engineers. Many of them had years of experiences and were very supportive and approachable. The most notable was my manager, James Cherry, whom I worked for as an assistant. As the term progressed I gained more and more responsibility; I started with testing his legacy code and ended with building a full web application from the ground up. I enjoyed this aspect of the role as I was able to gain exposure to professional code, learn cloud-computing first-hand, and develop my programming skills. With the automated tasks came an opportunity to contribute to the creation of the framework for deployment, management, and testing of containerized applications.
