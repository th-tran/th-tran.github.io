<h1 class="u-lead center">Conclusion</h1>

One of the key things I want to get out of a co-op placement is the opportunity to work in a technical environment that challenges me to improve myself every day. I did not expect that from my first work term. Auvik was the placement I was hoping for in regards to technical skills and projects. They offered me a wide variety of opportunities, and I am both a better coder and a better team member as a result. I am more familiar now with software development practices, collaborative software development, and version control software in the context of a team. The different challenges presented during my work term allowed me to meet many of the goals set for myself at the beginning of the semester. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work for Auvik.
