<h1 class="u-lead center">Conclusion</h1>

One of the key things I hope to get out of a co-op placement is the opportunity to work in a technical environment that challenges me to improve myself every day. Truth be told, I did not expect that from my first work term. Auvik was the placement I was hoping for in terms of application of technical skills and large-scale projects. They offered me a wide variety of opportunities, and I feel like I am both a better coder and a better team member as a result. I am now more familiar with software development practices, collaborative software development and version control software as it is used in teams. The different challenges presented during my work term allowed me to meet many of the goals set for myself at the beginning of the semester. I am highly thankful for the opportunity to work for Auvik.
