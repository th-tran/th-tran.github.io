UofG (University of Guelph) is a comprehensive public research university. Founded in 1964, UofG formed its roots in agriculture and veterinary medicine after the union of the Ontario Agriculture College and the Ontario Veterinary college. Today, the university remains well-known for its strength in these areas, but it has notably been shifting towards technology fields over the decades as well. Now, UofG is working in partnership with OMAFRA (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs) and several private sectors to lead the next generation of smart farms.
