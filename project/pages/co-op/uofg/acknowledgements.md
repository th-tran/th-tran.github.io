<h1 class="u-lead center">Acknowledgements</h1>

I would like to recognize those who helped me during my work term by making a few acknowledgments.

<h2 class="u-sublead">OMAFRA</h2>

A thank you goes to my co-op co-worker, Kevin Prince. Kevin was always approachable and helped me ramp up on technologies I was not familiar with. As we were the only developers on this project, we both pushed each other to do our best and kept each other accountable. Without him, it would have been much more difficult to complete the entire project. I am very grateful to have worked with him as he helped me to do my best work.

<h2 class="u-sublead">University of Guelph</h2>

From the school side of my co-op experience, I would like to give special thanks to Laura Gatto for being so understanding and supportive during such a delicate transitional time. Without her help, I may not have found these opportunities. I know she has many important duties to attend to, and I appreciate the hard work and time she dedicated to my success in my co-op semester.

I would like to thank Greg Klotz as well for always being willing to help and taking the time to read my work report. I know he is incredibly busy and has many work reports like this to read, and I appreciate the consideration and care he puts toward each one.

Thank you, everyone ðŸ™‚
