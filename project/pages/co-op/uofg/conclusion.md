<h1 class="u-lead center">Conclusion</h1>

One of the key things I want to get out of a co-op placement is the opportunity to work in a technical environment that challenges me to improve myself every day. UofG/OMAFRA was the placement I was searching for not only for technical skills but soft skills as well. By allowing for such a significant contribution from a co-op student, Iâ€™ve become a better coder and software team member as a result. My co-worker and I kept each other accountable, and I learned just as much from them this term as I did on my own. After seeing a project from start to finish, I am much more familiar now with software development practices, collaborative software development, and the software development cycle as a whole. The different challenges presented during my work term allowed me to meet many of the goals set for myself at the beginning of the semester. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work for UofG/OMAFRA.
