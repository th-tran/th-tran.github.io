During my 4-month work term, my role at UofG/OMAFRA was a Software Engineer. My duties included server-side scripting and maintaining databases â€“ the skills I needed most for the job were experience in Python and SQL. Good communication was an important factor of success in this role. The only developers on this project were myself and another co-op, Kevin Prince. There were many project stakeholders, and we had to stay in touch with them at all times to discuss and document our work. By collaborating with my co-worker and working with stakeholders, we built a platform that can collect and link high-quality farm data and store them in real-time on a cloud environment securely. To see a project grow to this stage in only four months was truly the most unique aspect of my job. I worked closely with my supervisor, Rozita Dara, to define and achieve various milestones along the way. The most rewarding part of my job was the responsibility given to me as a co-op student. Due to how things worked out, my co-worker and I essentially became lead developers on this project. Because of this, I got to experience everything from this perspective, including the responsibility and decision-making.
